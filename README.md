# node-hipchatbot
A basic bot for creating custom slash commands on Hipchat. 

#### Install dependencies
After cloning the files, Open up a command window and type the following:

`npm install`

This will install all the required node modules needed to get this basic app running.

#### Links

This integration can be deployed using Heroku. The Procfile in the repository is all that you will need to start the server.

Here is a guide for deploying a node app to Heroku: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs

Once this bot is deployed using either Heroku, AWS or any other platform, you can link it up to Hipchat and start using it to do...well, anything you tell it to do.

These custom slash command bots can be added to Hipchat by following the details contained in this Hipchat blog post.
